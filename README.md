With 16 years as head of IT for a Belgian municipality, I know local administrations inside and out. In 2022, I joined iMioâ€™s SmartWeb team, taking on a Swiss-army-knife role. In 2024, I also started working part-time with the DevOps team. As a passionate open-source enthusiast, I'm always eager to learn and grow.
